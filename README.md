## **Summary**

<pre>
I wrote this program to learn React.  This is my first time ever using a framework.
It was an experience learning it's intracacies, so mcuh so, that at some point I was
wondering why we even have frameworks.

I also learned Bootstrap 5.  The first is how CSS reacts with Bootstrap.  I started
using CSS style things and when I introduced Bootstrap, I spent hours tryhing to figure
out why things refused to work. So, I removed the CSS, and stuck with Bootstrap and then
things started working.
